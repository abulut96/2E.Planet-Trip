Description of the Project: 

PlanetTrip is a Java game we have chosen as our project. The game is inspired by by
Javanoid type arcade games. In such games, there is a map of meteors, a paddle and a ball.
Using paddle, player is supposed to give direction to ball and destroy all the meteors by
hitting them. Those bricks have different stiffness and some of them are harder to destroy
than others. 

Description of the Game:

“PlanetTrip” is a single player game. After selecting Play Game in main menu, user
can decide to play with any of nine levels and they are ordered with respect to their
challenges. In each level, user is presented with a map and meteors in it. They will move the
paddle by keyboard to direct the ball and not let it fall through the void. If ball falls, user will
lose one life and game will end if user has exhausted all their lives. Level will conclude and
next level will be unlocked if user hits and destroys all meteors.

In scenario, player will travel across the solar system, starting from Neptune to
the Sun. Each planet is a different level and player can see the respective planet in the
background. When player clears all meteors on the map, they can see the planet in its full
entirety and continue with the next level. As the player progresses with game, levels will be
more challenging to keep the sense of engagement. Currently game will have the following
features:
- Single Player Mode
- Level Selection [from Neptune to Sun]
We have chosen Java as our language for development because all group members are
experienced with that and it is a powerful language that supports principles of object oriented
programming. Using these principles will make our software easier to maintain and to add
new features without disrupting all parts of the program. We believe this project will be a
good exercise to learn and practice these principles. Moreover, developing a desktop
application with an UI component using Java is more straightforward compared to C/C++.
