Description of the Project: 

This project will be remake of classic the TV show "Who Wants to be a Billionaire". 
The development process will heavily build upon object oriented programming, allowing us to learn and practice the principles. We will use Java for coding, yet it may change in the future.

Description of the Game:

General: “Who Doesn't Want to be a Zillionaire Anyway” is a single-player game, which you answer questions to earn more points. With each right answer you skip to the next question, and any wrong answer will finish the game immediately. To win the game, you have to give the correct answers to 15 questions.

Controls: For answering the question, the player can either type the letter A, B, C, D; or click on one of four answers. For using a lifeline, the player has to click on the lifeline symbol and then choose the one to be used. 

Level Selection: Before starting the game, the user can select the difficulty of the game with the buttons such as "Easy", "Medium", "Hard".

Gameplay: On the right side, the game provides 3 lifelines. They are “audience” that generates a random answer that possible correct one for the question, “calling” that allows the user to ask one person what s/he thinks the correct answer is and “50:50” that eliminates two of the possible wrong answers. The user has to use them only once. The game continues as long as the user gives a correct answer. The questions become difficult towards the end.
